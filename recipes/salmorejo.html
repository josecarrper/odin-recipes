    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Salmorejo is a classic soup made primarily with tomatoes and bread. It’s best with a splash of sherry vinegar, but Andalusian tomatoes pack a good hit of acidity, so they often omit it in Spain. It’s also frequently made with pan de telera, a type of hard roll, which thickens the soup, but anything from a ciabatta to a rustic white loaf is good here.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds vine-ripened tomatoes, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pound rustic white bread, crust removed, bread cubed (2 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped serrano ham</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, puree the chopped tomatoes with the bread, garlic, sherry vinegar and 1/2 cup of water at high speed until very smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>With the blender on, drizzle in the 1/4 cup of olive oil until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate until the soup is cold, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the soup among 4 bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish with the chopped eggs and ham.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil and serve.</li>
        
    </ol>
